# PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE FOR TANZANIAâ€™S WATER INFRASTRUCTURE: A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH.


### Author: Joy Achieng Ogutu

# INTRODUCTION
Welcome to our presentation on Predicting Water Well Conditions in Tanzania. In this project, we deploy advanced machine learning techniques, specifically a well-tailored classifier, to gain insights into the state of water wells across the country. Our analysis is driven by a comprehensive dataset, encompassing various factors that influence the conditions of water wells.

The primary objective of our project is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates the conditions of water wells in Tanzania. This model aims to provide invaluable insights to different stakeholders, including NGOs focused on well rehabilitation, the Tanzanian government, and organisations dedicated to improving water infrastructure.

Throughout the presentation, we will walk you through our project's methodology, key findings, and the model's performance in predicting water well conditions. Thank you for joining us on this journey to enhance water infrastructure management in Tanzania.

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
### Tanzania's Water Infrastructure Background.
Tanzania, an East African nation with a population exceeding 57 million, faces significant obstacles in ensuring consistent access to clean water. The country's diverse geography, ranging from coastal plains to mountainous regions, significantly influences the distribution and availability of water resources. In many Tanzanian communities, wells serve as essential water sources, addressing the daily needs of both urban and rural populations. However, this reliance on wells introduces a set of challenges. To comprehend this intricate challenges, stakeholders must understand the factors influencing well functionality, most of which align with the columns provided in our dataset:

- Population Pressure: With a population of over 57 million, Tanzania is a developing nation where providing access to clean water is a major concern.
- Existing Water Points: There are now water points around the nation, but a substantial portion of them are either broken or in need of maintenance, which causes problems with water scarcity.
- Repair Difficulties: There are a lot of water wells that need to be maintained, and it can be difficult to determine which ones require urgent care. Extended durations of non-functionality may result from an absence of a methodical approach.
Resource Constraints: The government's capacity to fully solve problems with water infrastructure is hampered by a lack of funding and staff.
- Geographic Diversity: Tanzania's varied topography makes problems with water infrastructure more complicated and calls for regionally-adaptable solutions.
- Urbanisation Pressures: As cities grow, there is a greater need for water infrastructure, necessitating careful planning to fulfil the needs of an expanding population in an environmentally responsible manner.
- Data discrepancies: Developing targeted solutions is made more difficult by inconsistent data regarding the state of water points and their functionality.

The quality of water from these wells is a critical concern, given the risk of waterborne diseases. Long-term performance of water infrastructure, including wells, depends on maintenance; but, due to resource restrictions, routine repairs and upgrades are not possible. The Tanzanian government is aggressively tackling issues related to water by starting programs to upgrade water infrastructure, in conjunction with non-governmental organisations (NGOs), but given the scope of the problem, creative solutions are needed. Data challenges, including gathering accurate and up-to-date information on well conditions, hinder effective planning. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive and innovative approach, leveraging data-driven insights to inform sustainable solutions. The goal is not only to improve reliable access to clean water but also enhance the overall well-being of Tanzanian communities.

Our goal is to build a robust classifier leveraging machine learning techniques. By analysing various factors, such as pump types and installation dates, our predictive model aims to assist NGOs in pinpointing wells in need of repair and aid the government in identifying patterns in non-functional wells.
Problem Statement
Tanzania's water infrastructure faces critical challenges, particularly in the functionality of wells, leading to compromised access to clean water in many communities. The reliance on traditional wells, coupled with resource constraints and climate change, contributes to water scarcity and contamination risks. There is a critical need for data-driven insights, sustainable infrastructure development, and collaborative efforts among government entities, NGOs, and international partners. Such initiatives must prioritise the equitable distribution of resources and the empowerment of communities to ensure the long-term functionality of wells and, consequently, the well-being of Tanzanian populations.

### Objectives
1. Objective: To explore the relationship between water quality indicators and the functionality status of wells. Analyse data on water quality, considering variables such as the kind of waterpoint type, source of the water, water quality, water quantity and the kind of extraction the waterpoint uses. Identify whether the construction year of the well and well permits contribute to well failures and use the findings to implement targeted water quality improvement initiatives.

2. Objective: To assess the Impact of numeric variables on well functionality. This objective involves a comprehensive examination of the distribution and influence of numeric variables on well functionality. Analyse factors such as total static head, population around the well, and well altitude. Evaluate how these numeric features are distributed across various well conditions, providing insights into their individual and collective impact on well functionality.

3. Objective: To create an advanced predictive maintenance model capable of identifying water wells requiring repair. Leveraging historical data encompassing pertinent features, a multifaceted approach involving various machine learning classifiers will be employed. The objective includes extensive testing and comparison of different models to determine the most accurate and reliable predictor for identifying wells in need of timely rehabilitation. This initiative aims to enhance the proactive management of water wells.
